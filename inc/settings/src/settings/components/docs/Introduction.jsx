            <h2 id="introduction">Ollie Block Theme Docs</h2>

			<p>Ollie is a modern WordPress block theme by <a href="https://mikemcalister.com">Mike McAlister</a>. Ollie is built to work seamlessly with the WordPress block editor and site editor, where you can create beautiful, fully-customizable websites with WordPress’s built-in page builder — no page builder or coding skills required.</p>

			<p>Ollie ships with over 50 beautifully-designed patterns, page templates, block styles, and style variations so you can design stunning pages quickly with drag and drop instead of code. Ollie is also blazing fast, fully customizable via the WordPress UI, fully responsive out of the box, and scores 100% across the board on performance.</p>

			<p>My goal with OllieWP.com and this theme is to help educate both long-time and new WordPress creators about the many powerful, new features WordPress has to offer. Please feel free to dig through the code and learn a bit more about how to make WordPress block themes. ✌️</p>
